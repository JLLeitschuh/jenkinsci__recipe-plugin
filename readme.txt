TODO:
 - if recipe requires some plugins which in turn requires a restart,
   user needs to be guided through the restart process.

 - we allow the job names to be changed during import.
   Any way to update references to them? (job names in a view, upstream/downstream references, ...)

 - allow JobIngredient to carry some human readable explanation of what this job does
