    Machine-readable unique identifier of this recipe.
    We recommend you use camel case names such as "jenkinsCoreBuild".
    For those who really care about uniqueness can use the reverse domain name notion like
    the one used in Java package names, such as <tt>org.jenkinsci.recipes.core.build</tt>.
